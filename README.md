# Hello, I'm Taras! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a beginer in software engineering from Ukraine 🇺🇦, currently working on various projects and always learning new things. 
Here you’ll find my work, including projects in **C++** and **Qt**.

## About Me
I’m passionate about software development, and I enjoy tackling complex problems to create efficient, practical solutions. 
My main areas of focus include **C++**, **Qt**, and **Embedded Systems**. 
I’m always expanding my knowledge and currently diving into **Go** and **WinAPI** to broaden my skill set.

I’m currently working on a **telecommunications system** that integrates several technologies, including **C++**, **Qt**, **ESP32**, **SIM800L**, and a backend written in **Go**.  
The project focuses on building an intuitive and reliable system for managing communication services, combining desktop, embedded, and server-side components.

Outside of coding, I like to explore each topic as deeply as possible — aiming to understand how things work at the lowest levels. 
Wherever possible, I experiment hands-on, striving to grasp not just how to use a technology, but how and why it works under the hood.

## Technologies & Tools
- 💻 **Programming Languages**: C++, Go
- 🛠️ **Frameworks & Tools**: Qt, PostgreSQL, SQLite
- 🖥️ **Tools**: Git, GitHub, QtCreator, Vim, Linux(Kubuntu, Debian)
- 🌐 **Learning**: WinAPI, OpenGL, Go, Embedded Systems, Networking, IoT

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I’m currently working on:
- **Telecommunication System** (C++ with Qt)  
- **Desktop Application for Telecom Services**  
- **Embedded Systems** using **ESP32**  
- **Backend System for SMS Management**  
  A server-side application that communicates with **ESP32** to send SMS messages.
  This system manages communication between the server and connected devices, handling SMS dispatching through an embedded module.
